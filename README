1. Font Directory:
    This directory contains the style files for the application in
-cluding the fonts and the .css, which could make the interface be
more variable and beautiful to the users.
The contains are supported by the fontawesome.com with version 4.2
The IE-7 solustion open code are supported by the ThinkCMF.com from
China.

2. img/img2/img3 Directory:
    This sort of directory include image used as the background and
the number is different for the style changed during the implementa
-ion procedures.

3. movie/video files:
    This type of files are used by the studying sections and due to 
the lack of material source, I temporally put them outside of the 
directory even though they should be in.

4. html files:
    This type of files are the core codes files for the application
including the design for the menu, the background, links and the ov
-erall arrangement of the application.
    To specific, the algorithms for the calculators are supported by
the open source code in github and the CFA institute.

5. JS Directory:
    This directory also contains the files for styling no matter it
is JQuerry or Javascripts.

Finally, Thanks for professor Erin Solovey and her supports!
